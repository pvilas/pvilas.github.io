Salvatore Sanfilippo (aka *Antirez*) és el creador de [Redis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redis) i li fan una entrevista a la revista [Rediscover](https://redislabs.com/rediscover-magazine/). Els consells finals, no per més que es repeteixin, són menys veritat:

**Finally, based on your experience creating and
building Redis, do you have any recommendations
for other programmers?**

1. Don’t make things more complex than needed.
2. Don’t be a perfectionist at all costs. “The perfect
is the enemy of the good.” Don’t keep endlessly
iterating in search of a perfection that users don’t
even want: they want working systems now, not
something more perfect later.
3. Try to make incremental progress every day.
4. Be the storyteller for the projects you work on.
5. Love what you do. Success is a byproduct, not a
goal you can reach directly, and may not happen
at all. It’s important to enjoy the journey.
